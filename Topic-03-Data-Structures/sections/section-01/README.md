# Section 1: Working with Lists and Sets

**Topic**: 3 - Python Data Structures & JSON API Work
**Section**: 1 of 2 sections (90 min)
**Level**: Beginner to Intermediate
**Prerequisites**: Basic Python syntax, Topic 1 & 2

---

## 📋 Section Overview

This section introduces Python's fundamental data structures: lists and sets. You'll learn how to manipulate, process, and analyze data using these powerful built-in types. Through hands-on exercises, you'll build practical utilities for common data processing tasks.

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

1. **Master List Operations**: Add, remove, update, sort, and filter list elements efficiently
2. **Apply List Comprehensions**: Write concise, readable code for list transformations
3. **Perform Set Operations**: Use union, intersection, difference operations for data analysis
4. **Convert Between Data Types**: Transform lists to sets and vice versa appropriately
5. **Understand Performance**: Choose the right data structure for different scenarios
6. **Build Data Processing Utilities**: Create reusable functions for common data tasks

## 🛠️ Key Concepts Covered

### Lists
- **Operations**: append, extend, insert, remove, pop, clear
- **Searching**: index, count, in operator
- **Sorting**: sort(), sorted(), key functions
- **Comprehensions**: Basic and nested list comprehensions
- **Performance**: When lists are the right choice

### Sets
- **Operations**: add, remove, discard, pop, clear
- **Mathematical Operations**: union, intersection, difference, symmetric difference
- **Performance**: Fast membership testing and deduplication
- **Use Cases**: When sets are more appropriate than lists

### Data Processing
- **Filtering**: Multiple condition filtering with custom functions
- **Transformation**: Pipeline transformations with function composition
- **Analysis**: Frequency counting, grouping, statistical operations
