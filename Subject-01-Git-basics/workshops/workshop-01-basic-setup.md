## Part 1: Installing Git

### Step 1: Identify Your Operating System
**What you'll do:** Determine which installation guide to follow.

**Instructions:**
1. Check your operating system:
   - Windows: Press `Win + R`, type `winver`, press Enter
   - macOS: Click Apple menu → About This Mac
   - Linux: Open terminal and run `cat /etc/os-release`

2. Note your OS version for reference during troubleshooting

**Expected Result:**
You know your OS and version (e.g., "Windows 11", "macOS Ventura", "Ubuntu 22.04")

### Step 2: Download and Install Git

**Windows Users:**

1. Open your web browser and go to: https://git-scm.com/download/win
2. Click the download link (should start automatically)
3. Locate the downloaded file (usually in Downloads folder)
4. Double-click the `.exe` file to start installation
5. Follow the installation wizard:
   - Click "Next" on the information screen
   - Keep all components selected, click "Next"
   - Choose your preferred editor, click "Next"
   - **Important:** Select "Git from the command line and also from 3rd-party software", click "Next"
   - Keep other defaults, click "Install"
   - Click "Finish"

**macOS Users:**

**Option A: Homebrew (Recommended)**
1. Open Terminal (Applications → Utilities → Terminal)
2. Install Homebrew (if not installed):
   ```bash
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
   ```
3. Install Git:
   ```bash
   brew install git
   ```

**Option B: Xcode Command Line Tools**
1. Open Terminal
2. Run: `xcode-select --install`
3. Click "Install" when prompted
4. Wait for installation to complete

**Linux Users:**

**Ubuntu/Debian:**
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git
```

**CentOS/RHEL/Fedora:**
```bash
sudo dnf install git  # or sudo yum install git
```

**Arch Linux:**
```bash
sudo pacman -S git
```

---

### Step 3: Verify Installation

**What you'll do:** Confirm Git is installed correctly.

**Instructions:**
1. Open your terminal/command prompt:
   - Windows: Search for "Command Prompt" or "PowerShell"
   - macOS: Applications → Utilities → Terminal
   - Linux: Search for "Terminal" in applications

2. Type the following command and press Enter:
   ```bash
   git --version
   ```

**Expected Output:**
```
git version 2.x.x      # Version number may vary
```

**If you see an error:**
- Windows: Try running Command Prompt as Administrator
- macOS/Linux: Check if you used `sudo` for installation
- All platforms: Restart your terminal and try again

---

## Part 2: Basic Git Configuration

### Step 4: Configure User Identity

**What you'll do:** Set up your name and email for Git commits.

**Instructions:**
1. In your terminal, run these commands (replace with your actual information):

   ```bash
   git config --global user.name "Your Full Name"
   git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
   ```

   **Example:**
   ```bash
   git config --global user.name "John Doe"
   git config --global user.email "john.doe@university.edu"
   ```

2. Verify your configuration:
   ```bash
   git config --global user.name
   git config --global user.email
   ```

**Expected Output:**
```
John Doe
john.doe@university.edu
```

### Step 5: Set Default Branch Name

**Instructions:**
```bash
git config --global init.defaultBranch main
```

**Verification:**
```bash
git config --global init.defaultBranch
```

**Expected Output:**
```
main
```

### Step 6: Configure Line Endings (Platform-Specific)

**Windows:**
```bash
git config --global core.autocrlf true
```

**macOS/Linux:**
```bash
git config --global core.autocrlf input
```

### Step 7: Enable Helpful Features

**Instructions:**
```bash
git config --global pull.rebase false
git config --global color.ui auto
git config --global core.editor "nano"  # or "code" for VS Code
```

---

### Step 8: View Complete Configuration

**Instructions:**
```bash
git config --global --list
```

**Expected Output:** (similar to)
```
user.name=John Doe
user.email=john.doe@university.edu
init.defaultBranch=main
core.autocrlf=true
pull.rebase=false
color.ui=auto
core.editor=nano
```

---

## Part 3: Testing Your Setup

### Step 9: Create a Test Repository

**What you'll do:** Create your first Git repository to test everything works.

**Instructions:**
1. Create a new directory for testing:
   ```bash
   mkdir git-test
   cd git-test
   ```

2. Initialize Git repository:
   ```bash
   git init
   ```

3. Create a test file:
   ```bash
   echo "# My First Git Repository" > README.md
   echo "print('Hello, Git!')" > hello.py
   ```

4. Check status:
   ```bash
   git status
   ```

**Expected Output:**
```
On branch main

No commits yet

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        README.md
        hello.py

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

### Step 10: Make Your First Commit

**Instructions:**
1. Add files to staging:
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

2. Check status again:
   ```bash
   git status
   ```

3. Commit the files:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Initial commit: Add README and hello.py"
   ```

4. Check the log:
   ```bash
   git log --oneline
   ```

**Expected Output:**
```
abc1234 Initial commit: Add README and hello.py
```

### Step 11: Clean Up Test Repository

**Instructions:**
```bash
cd ..
rm -rf git-test
```

---

## Part 4: Optional Advanced Setup

### Setting Up SSH Keys (Recommended for GitHub)

**Why SSH?** More secure than passwords, no need to enter credentials repeatedly.

**Instructions:**

1. Generate SSH key:
   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your.email@example.com"
   ```
   Press Enter for all prompts (or set a passphrase)

2. Copy public key to clipboard:
   - macOS: `pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub`
   - Linux: `xclip -sel clip < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub`
   - Windows: `type %USERPROFILE%\.ssh\id_ed25519.pub`

3. Go to GitHub.com → Settings → SSH and GPG keys → New SSH key
4. Paste your public key and save

4. Test connection:
   ```bash
   ssh -T git@github.com
   ```

**Expected Output:**
```
Hi username! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
```

## Troubleshooting

### "git is not recognized as an internal or external command" (Windows)
**Solution:**
1. Check if Git is installed: Control Panel → Programs → Programs and Features
2. If installed, add to PATH:
   - Open System Properties → Advanced → Environment Variables
   - Find "Path" in System variables
   - Add: `C:\Program Files\Git\cmd`
   - Restart Command Prompt

### Permission denied during installation
**Solution:** Run installer as Administrator (Windows) or use `sudo` (macOS/Linux)

### "xcode-select: command not found" (macOS)
**Solution:** Install Xcode from App Store first, or use Homebrew method

### SSH connection fails
**Solution:**
- Check if SSH key exists: `ls ~/.ssh/`
- Verify public key is added to GitHub
- Try: `ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519` (if using passphrase)

### Configuration not working
**Solution:**
- Check for typos in commands
- Use `git config --global --list` to verify
- Try without `--global` for repository-specific config
