# Subject 2: Python Data Structures & JSON API Work

## Overview

This subject focuses on advanced Python data structures and JSON handling, with practical API integration using real-world examples. Students will learn to manipulate lists, sets, and dictionaries while building skills in API consumption and data processing.

## Learning Path

### 1. Lists and Sets Operations
- **List Operations**: Adding, removing, updating, sorting, filtering elements
- **List Comprehensions**: Advanced list creation and transformation
- **Set Operations**: Union, intersection, difference, symmetric difference
- **Performance Considerations**: When to use lists vs sets
- **Type Conversions**: Converting between lists and sets

### 2. JSON and Dictionary Handling
- **JSON Data Structure**: Understanding JSON format and Python dictionaries
- **Dictionary Operations**: CRUD operations on dictionaries
- **Nested Data Structures**: Working with complex nested objects
- **File I/O**: Reading and writing JSON files
- **HTTP Requests**: Using requests library for API calls
- **API Response Processing**: Handling JSON responses from APIs

### 3. Practical API Integration
- **RandomUser.me API**: Real-world API example
- **Data Extraction**: Parsing and extracting relevant information
- **Data Transformation**: Converting API data to usable formats
- **Error Handling**: Managing API failures and timeouts
- **Rate Limiting**: Respecting API usage limits

## Key Topics

- **Lists**: Operations, comprehensions, performance
- **Sets**: Mathematical operations, uniqueness, conversions
- **Dictionaries**: Key-value operations, nested structures
- **JSON**: Serialization, deserialization, file operations
- **Requests Library**: HTTP methods, headers, authentication
- **API Integration**: Real-world data fetching and processing

## Prerequisites

- Basic Python knowledge (variables, loops, functions)
- Understanding of basic data types (strings, numbers, booleans)
- Basic command line usage

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this subject, students will be able to:

1. **List Operations**: Perform advanced list manipulations using built-in methods and comprehensions
2. **Set Operations**: Apply mathematical set operations and understand performance implications
3. **Dictionary Management**: Handle complex dictionary operations including nested structures
4. **JSON Processing**: Read, write, and manipulate JSON data
5. **API Integration**: Make HTTP requests and process JSON responses
6. **Data Transformation**: Convert between different data formats and structures
7. **Error Handling**: Manage API errors and edge cases appropriately

## Progression

1. **Start with Lists and Sets** (Workshop 1) - Master fundamental data structure operations
2. **Learn JSON and Dictionaries** (Tutorial 2) - Understand data serialization
3. **Practice API Integration** (Workshop 2) - Build real-world API consumers
4. **Apply Knowledge** (Homework) - Create practical data processing applications

## Tools Coverage

| Tool/Library | Coverage Level | Purpose |
|-------------|----------------|---------|
| **Built-in types** | **Primary focus** | Lists, sets, dictionaries |
| **json module** | **Core feature** | JSON serialization/deserialization |
| **requests** | **API integration** | HTTP client for API calls |
| **randomuser.me API** | **Practical example** | Real-world API usage |

## Special Focus: Practical API Work

This subject emphasizes practical, real-world programming skills:

- **Real API Usage**: Working with actual web APIs (randomuser.me)
- **Data Processing**: Transforming API responses into usable data
- **Error Handling**: Robust error management for production code
- **Performance Awareness**: Understanding data structure performance characteristics

## Assessment Strategy

- **Workshops**: Guided exercises with step-by-step data manipulation
- **Homework**: Independent projects requiring API integration
- **Quizzes**: Concept verification for data structure understanding
- **Code Reviews**: Best practices in data handling and API usage

## Next Steps

Begin with **Workshop 1: List and Set Operations** to understand fundamental data structure manipulations, then progress to **Workshop 2: JSON API Integration** to apply these skills with real-world APIs.
