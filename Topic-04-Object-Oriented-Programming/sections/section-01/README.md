# Section 1: OOP Fundamentals

**Topic**: 4 - Object-Oriented Programming
**Section**: 1 of 4 sections (90 min)
**Level**: Intermediate
**Prerequisites**: Topics 1-3 (Basic Python, Data Structures)

---

## 📋 Section Overview

This section introduces the fundamental concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python. You'll learn to create classes, instantiate objects, and understand the core principles of encapsulation. Through practical examples, you'll build a solid foundation for object-oriented design.

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

1. **Define Classes**: Create class blueprints with proper structure
2. **Create Objects**: Instantiate objects and understand object lifecycle
3. **Implement Methods**: Write instance methods with proper `self` usage
4. **Work with Attributes**: Manage instance and class variables
5. **Apply Encapsulation**: Control access to object data
6. **Design Basic OOP Solutions**: Structure simple object-oriented programs

1. **Tutorial**: Learn class/object fundamentals
2. **Workshop**: Apply concepts in practical exercises
3. **Homework**: Independent OOP system implementation

### **Topic Foundation**
- Builds on procedural programming from Topics 1-3
- Introduces object-oriented thinking paradigm
- Foundation for all subsequent OOP sections

### **Leading to Section 2**
- Section 1 provides basic class/object knowledge
- Section 2 extends with inheritance relationships
- Combined foundation enables advanced OOP concepts

## 🛠️ Key Concepts Covered

### Class Definition
- **Class Syntax**: `class ClassName:` structure
- **Naming Conventions**: PascalCase for class names
- **Class Body**: Methods and class variables

### Object Creation
- **Instantiation**: `object = ClassName()`
- **Constructor**: `__init__` method role
- **Object Identity**: Each object is unique

### Instance Variables
- **Definition**: Variables unique to each object
- **Access**: Through `self.variable_name`
- **Initialization**: Set in `__init__` method

### Instance Methods
- **Definition**: Functions that operate on object data
- **Self Parameter**: Reference to the current object
- **Method Calls**: `object.method_name()`

### Class Variables
- **Definition**: Variables shared across all instances
- **Access**: Through `ClassName.variable_name` or `self.__class__.variable_name`
- **Use Cases**: Constants, shared counters

### Basic Encapsulation
- **Data Hiding**: Protecting internal object state
- **Access Control**: Private vs public attributes
- **Getter/Setter Patterns**: Controlled attribute access
