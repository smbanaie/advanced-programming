# Section 4: Design Patterns

**Topic**: 4 - Object-Oriented Programming
**Section**: 4 of 4 sections (90 min)
**Level**: Advanced
**Prerequisites**: Sections 1-3 (OOP Fundamentals through Advanced Concepts)

---

## 📋 Section Overview

This section explores common design patterns that provide proven solutions to recurring software design problems. You'll learn to implement Singleton, Factory, Observer, and Strategy patterns using the advanced OOP concepts from previous sections. Through practical examples, you'll understand when and how to apply these patterns to create maintainable, flexible software architectures.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

1. **Implement Singleton Pattern**: Create classes that ensure only one instance exists
2. **Apply Factory Pattern**: Build flexible object creation mechanisms
3. **Use Observer Pattern**: Implement event-driven systems with loose coupling
4. **Utilize Strategy Pattern**: Create interchangeable algorithms and behaviors
5. **Design Pattern Combinations**: Combine multiple patterns for complex solutions
6. **Pattern Selection**: Choose appropriate patterns for different design problems

## 🛠️ Key Concepts Covered

### Singleton Pattern
- **Thread-Safe Implementation**: Ensure single instance across threads
- **Lazy Initialization**: Create instance only when needed
- **Registry Pattern**: Manage multiple singletons
- **Metaclass Approach**: Advanced singleton implementation

### Factory Pattern
- **Simple Factory**: Basic object creation abstraction
- **Factory Method**: Delegate creation to subclasses
- **Abstract Factory**: Create families of related objects
- **Builder Pattern**: Complex object construction

### Observer Pattern
- **Subject-Observer Relationship**: Loose coupling between objects
- **Event System**: Publish-subscribe mechanism
- **Callback Functions**: Flexible event handling
- **Middleware Pattern**: Intercept and modify events

### Strategy Pattern
- **Algorithm Encapsulation**: Interchangeable behaviors
- **Context Class**: Configurable behavior at runtime
- **Strategy Interface**: Common interface for algorithms
- **Composition over Inheritance**: Runtime behavior changes

### Pattern Combinations
- **Factory + Singleton**: Centralized object creation
- **Observer + Strategy**: Event-driven algorithm selection
- **Strategy + Factory**: Dynamic algorithm instantiation
- **Observer + Singleton**: Global event management
