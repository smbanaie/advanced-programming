# Section 2: Inheritance & Polymorphism

**Topic**: 4 - Object-Oriented Programming
**Section**: 2 of 4 sections (90 min)
**Level**: Intermediate
**Prerequisites**: Section 1 (OOP Fundamentals)

---

## 📋 Section Overview

This section explores inheritance and polymorphism, two fundamental pillars of Object-Oriented Programming. You'll learn how to create class hierarchies, override methods, and design flexible systems that can work with different object types through a common interface. Through practical examples, you'll build more sophisticated object-oriented designs.

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

1. **Implement Inheritance**: Create child classes that inherit from parent classes
2. **Override Methods**: Customize inherited behavior in child classes
3. **Use `super()`**: Access parent class methods and constructors
4. **Apply Polymorphism**: Design systems that work with multiple object types
5. **Design Class Hierarchies**: Structure related classes effectively
6. **Use Abstract Base Classes**: Define common interfaces for related classes

## 🛠️ Key Concepts Covered

### Inheritance
- **Single Inheritance**: `class Child(Parent):` syntax
- **Accessing Parent**: Using `super()` for parent method calls
- **Inheritance Chain**: Multiple levels of inheritance
- **Method Resolution Order (MRO)**: Python's method lookup sequence

### Method Overriding
- **Override Syntax**: Same method name in child class
- **Extending Behavior**: Call parent method + add functionality
- **Complete Replacement**: Full method reimplementation
- **Polymorphic Methods**: Same interface, different behavior

### Polymorphism
- **Duck Typing**: "If it walks like a duck..."
- **Method Polymorphism**: Same method, different implementations
- **Runtime Binding**: Dynamic method resolution
- **Interface Design**: Common methods across classes

### Abstract Base Classes
- **ABC Module**: `from abc import ABC, abstractmethod`
- **Abstract Methods**: Must be implemented by subclasses
- **Interface Definition**: Contract for implementing classes
- **Type Checking**: Runtime type validation
